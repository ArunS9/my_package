Build your ROS 2 workspace:

bash

cd /path/to/your/ros2_workspace
colcon build

Usage

To launch the simulation environment with the robot, follow these steps:

    Launch the bot_world.launch.py file:

bash

ros2 launch bot_world bot_world.launch.py

This will start Gazebo with the provided world file (my_world.world) and spawn the robot at the center of the world.

    You can now interact with the robot in the Gazebo simulation environment.

Notes

    Ensure that Gazebo and ROS 2 are properly installed and configured on your system.
    Make sure to adjust paths and filenames as per your specific setup.
